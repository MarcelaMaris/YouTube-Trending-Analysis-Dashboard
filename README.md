## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Data Analytics Bootcamp at [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com)**.
It focuses on automating weekly analytics for **YouTube trending videos**, building a **Tableau dashboard** for ad-planning managers to track category trends and regional differences over time.

The dashboard helps answer:

* Which video categories trended most often last week?
* How were they distributed among regions?
* Which categories were especially popular in the United States?
